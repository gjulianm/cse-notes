\subsection{Transport theorem and conservation of mass}

The transport theorem models the change of a certain quantity enclosed in a volume $Ω$. That change responds to changes in the quantity to measure and in the shape of Ω.

\begin{theorem}[Transport\IS theorem] Let $Ω(t) ∈ ℝ^3$ be a volume shape, with its shape change modeled by the velocity field $\appl{\vu}{ℝ^3 × ℝ}{ℝ}$ and $\appl{b}{ℝ^3×ℝ}{ℝ}$ the quantity being modeled. Then, the change over time of the total flux can be expressed as \( \od{}{t} \int_{Ω(t)} b(\vx, t) \dif V_t = \int_{Ω(t)} \dpd{b}{t} \dif V_t + \int_{∂Ω(t)} (\vu · \vn) b(\vx, t) \dif A_t \label{eq:TransportTheorem} \) where $\vn$ is the normal to $Ω(t)$, and $V_t, A_t$ are the volume and are elements of $Ω(t)$.
\end{theorem}

Basically, this theorem says that the change is accounted for by the change of the quantity itself plus the change of the flux exiting or entering the volume.

There are several expressions for conservation of mass based on \eqref{eq:TransportTheorem}:
\begin{align*}
\od{}{t}\iiint_Ω ρ \dif V + \iint_{∂Ω} ρ\vu \dif A &\qquad \text{Integral conservation form}\\
\frac{\Dif}{\Dif t} \iiint_V ρ \dif V = 0 &\qquad \text{Integral nonconservation form}\\
\dpd{ρ}{t} + \dv (ρ \vu) = 0 &\qquad \text{Differential conservation} \\
\frac{\Dif ρ}{\Dif t} + ρ \dv \vu = 0 &\qquad \text{Differential nonconservation}
\end{align*} where $ρ$ is the density of the fluid.

For an incompressible flow, we have $ρ$ constant and then we have $\dv \vu = 0$, which is usually called the \concept{Continuity\IS equation}.

\subsection{Stress modeling and momentum conservation}

Then some equation \[ ρ \od{b}{t} = Q + \dv A\] where $A$ are volume sources and $A$ surface fluxes.

For the surface forces, we can use a theorem due to Cauchy that shows that the surface force can be represented by a stress tensor\footnote{Also known in this context as a $3 × 3$ matrix.}, so the force is $\vt = σ \vn$.

We will divide the stresses in the fluid in two parts: one static, existing even in the abscene of motion (that is, pressure); and another one related to motion.

Pressure exerts a force normal to the surface, that is, $\vf(x) = -p(x) \vn(x)$ and the stress tensor is $σ = -p(x) I $ with $I$ the identity matrix.

For stresses in a moving fluid, we add forces tangential to the surface that are represented by a second part of the stress tensor, $τ(\vx)$, that is called the viscous stress tensor.

The viscous stress tensor has two group of components, $τ_{xx}, τ_{yy}, τ_{zz}$ which are the stretching terms; and the other ones (symmetric) which are the shear terms. Thus conservation of momentum is given by \[ ρ \frac{\Dif \vu}{\Dif t} = \dv σ + ρ \vf \]


\subsection{Navier-Stokes for incompressible fluids}

In our incompressible flow, we have that the viscous tensor is the symmetric part of the velocity so that $D = \frac{\trans{∇u} + ∇u}{2}$ and $ σ = - pI + 2μD$ and thus putting everything together the results is \begin{align*}
ρ \frac{\Dif \vu}{\Dif t} &= - ∇p + μΔ\vu + ρ \vf \\
\dv \vu &= 0
\end{align*}

In order to solve these equations, boundary conditions will be set at time $t = 0$ (initial conditions); and also at the interfaces.

For example, for liquid/solid interfaces, we will use either no-slip boundary conditions ($\vu_\text{liquid} = \vu_\text{solid}$ at the interface) or non-penetration ($\vu_\text{liquid} · \vn = \vu_\text{solid} · \vn$).

For liquid/liquid interfaces, we will have continuity of velocity $\vu_1 = \vu_2$, free-slip conditions ($\vu_{1} · \vn = \vu_{2} · \vn = \vv_\text{interface}$) or continuity of stress ($σ_1 · \vn = σ_2 · \vn$).

Finally, for liquid/gas interfaces (free surfaces), we have either no-slip or no-stress ($σ·\vn = 0$).

We will also non-dimensional equation in which we use gauges to measure the quantities of interest for the problem.

\chapter{Stokes flow}

In this chapter we will consider Stokes flow, also called creeping flow. First, we will need to introduce the streamfunction, which greatly simplifies the study of this flow.

\section{Streamfunction}

\begin{defn}[Streamfunction] \label{def:Streamfunction} For a given 2-dimensional incompressible flow, the streamfunction $ψ(x,y,t)$ is defined as the volume flux through a curve from $A_0$ (a reference point) to the point $(x,y)$. This gives the following expressions for velocity $\vU = (u, v, 0)$ of the flow (in cartesian coordinates):
\( u = \dpd{ψ}{y} \qquad v = - \dpd{ψ}{x} \label{eq:StreamfunctionCartesian}\)
\end{defn}

The interesting thing about the streamfunction is that by its definition it can only applied to incompressible fluids. Indeed, if we calculate the divergence of the flow we have \[ \dv \vU = \dpd{u}{x} + \dpd{v}{y} = \mder{ψ}{2}{x}{}{y}{} -\mder{ψ}{2}{y}{}{x}{} = 0 \]

If we change to cylindrical coordinates with axisymmetry (remember that streamfunction model 2D flows), the equations change to \( \label{eq:StreamfunctionCylindricalAxisym} u = \frac{1}{r} \dpd{ψ}{r} \qquad v = - \frac{1}{r} \dpd{ψ}{z} \) and one can check that we still have conservation of mass.

\subsection{Relation to vorticity}

Remember that the vorticity of a flow is defined as $\vec{ω} = \rot \vU$. If we use the streamfunction formulation, we end up with the following short expression:
\[ \vec{ω} = - Δψ \ve_z\] which is incredibly convenient. Using this expressions in Navier-Stokes equations we would end up with advection-diffusion forms:
\[ \dpd{ω}{t} + u \dpd{ω}{x} + v \dpd{ω}{y} = ν Δω \]

\section{Stokes equation}

In order to derive the Stokes equation, we start off from Newton incompressible flow equations:
\[ ρ \frac{\Dif \vU}{\Dif t} = - ∇ p + μ Δ \vU + ρ\vf \]

Assuming no external forces ($\vf \equiv 0$) and steady flow, we have the following simplification:
\( \begin{aligned}
ηΔ\vU &= ∇p \\
\dv \vU &= 0
\end{aligned} \label{eq:StokesFlow} \)

We can derive that to other formulations:
\begin{gather*}
Δp = 0 \\
Δω = 0
\end{gather*}

The last one gives rise to the biharmonic equation: \[ ∇^4 ψ = Δ(Δψ) = 0 \] which is a fully determined equation once we put in boundary conditions.

An interesting fact from the linearity of the equations is that the flow is reversible: if we change the sign we have still a solution.

Additionally, the unique solution of the Stokes equations with suitable boundary conditions is the divergence free flow field that minimizes viscous dissipation, which is given by \[ φ = 2 μ \int e_{ij} e_{ij} \dif V \]

\subsection{Flow along a sphere}

We are going to study the flow along a sphere of radius $a$, in order to see why the falling. In this case, the Stokes streamfunction in spherical coordinates is given by
\( \label{eq:FlowSphereStokes}\begin{aligned}
U_r(r,θ) &= \frac{1}{r^2 \sin θ} \dpd{ψ}{θ} \\
U_θ(r,θ) &= -\frac{1}{r \sin θ} \dpd{ψ}{r}
\end{aligned} \)

We can also look at the rotational in spherical coordinates, which is \[ \vec{ω} = \rot \vU = \frac{1}{r} \left( \dpd{rU_θ}{r} - \dpd{U_r}{θ}\right)\ve_φ = - \frac{1}{r\sin θ} \left(\dpd[2]{ψ}{r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \dpd[2]{ψ}{θ} - \frac{\cot θ}{r^2} \dpd{ψ}{θ}\right) \ve_ψ \] and therefore we have the final equation of the bilaplacian as \( Δ^2_s ψ ≝ \left(\dpd[2]{}{r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \dpd[2]{}{θ} - \frac{\cot θ}{r^2} \dpd{}{θ}\right)^2 ψ = 0 \label{eq:BilaplacianSphereFlow} \)

For the boundary conditions, in the frame of the sphere we have no-slip and thus $u_r(a, θ) = u_θ(a, θ) = 0$. By plugging this into the expression of the flow from \eqref{eq:FlowSphereStokes}, we find the following restriction on the streamfunction: \[ ψ(a, θ) = \dpd{ψ}{r}(a, θ) = 0 \]

We also need far-field boundary conditions. When $r \to ∞$, we want $\vU(r, θ) \to U_∞ \ve_z$, so that we need \[ U_r \sim U_∞ \cos θ \qquad U_θ \sim -U_∞ \sin θ \quad\text{when } r \to ∞\]

Plugging that in \eqref{eq:FlowSphereStokes}, we have that \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{r^2 \sinθ} \dpd{ψ}{θ} &\convs[][r][∞] U_∞ \cos θ \\
\dpd{ψ}{θ} &\convs[][r][∞] U_∞ r^2 \cos θ \sin θ \\
ψ &\convs[][r][∞] \frac{U_∞r^2 \sin^2 θ}{2}
\end{align*} and doing that with $U_θ$ yields the same result. We are using, though, a very informal definition of convergence of functions.

We are going to suppose that the solution is of the form $ψ = f(r) \sin^2 θ$. We can compute the derivatives of this thing:
\begin{align*}
\dpd{ψ}{θ} &=  2 f(r) \sin θ \cos θ \\
\dpd[2]{ψ}{θ} &= 2 f(r) (\cos^2 θ - \sin^2 θ)
\end{align*}

Putting that in the equation of the bilaplacian \eqref{eq:BilaplacianSphereFlow}, we will have that \[Δ_s ψ = f'' \sin^2 θ + \frac{2f}{r^2} (\cos^2 θ  - \sin^2 θ) - \frac{\cos θ}{r^2 \sin θ} 2f(r) \sin θ \cos θ  \]

Computing the laplacian again we end up with \[ Δ_s^2 ψ = \left(\dod[2]{}{r} - \frac{2}{r^2}\right)^2 f \]
