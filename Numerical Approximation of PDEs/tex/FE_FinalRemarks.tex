\section{Numerical approximation of PDEs II}

Witht the Laplace equation, we proved the regularity, a priori for the solution and gradient. A posteriori error estimates, goal oriented estimation and post processed ZZ gradient. THe proofs too. Know the error estimators too.
 Conditions on structured meshes and cancelation terms.

Then we saw the stokes problem $-Δu + ∇p = f$ with $\dv u = 0$, using the inf-sup condition. Optimal control

Then non-linear problems. The theorem and things but also important the a priori error estimator.s

Heat equation.
