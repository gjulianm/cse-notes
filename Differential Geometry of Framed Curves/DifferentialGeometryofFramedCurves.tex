\chapter{Framed curves or curves in $SE(3)$}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\caption{The object of our study is the study of framed curves in the space of rigid body motions. In this space, we represent the position of an object (a displacement $\vr$) but also its rotation in space, represented by the transformation of the frame of reference (in purple).}
\label{fig:FramedCurve}
\end{figure}

During this course, we will study curves in the special euclidean group $SE(3)$, the Lie group of matrix representing rigid body motions. It is called like this because, as explained in \fref{fig:FramedCurve}, we want to have a displacement and also a transformation of the frame of reference.

This has a direct translation to the matrix representation of $SE(3)$: \(
\left(\begin{array}{ccc|c}
 & & &  \\
 & R & & \vec{r} \\
 & & &  \\ \hline
 & \vec{0} & & 1
\end{array}\right) \label{eq:SE3MatrixRepr} \), where $R ∈ SO(3)$ is a matrix representing the rotation and $\vr ∈ ℝ^3$ is a vector representing the movement or position in space.

The fact that $R ∈ SO(3)$ (special orthogonal group) gives us the necessary restrictions on allowable rotations. Rotations of the frame of reference must be isometries, and must preserve orientations. Thus, $\det R = 1$ for all $R ∈ SO(3)$.


\section{The living space $SE(3)$}

Once we now the reason of working in this space, we can go for the formal definitions and see how do operations behave in here.

\begin{defn}[Special orthogonal group $SO(N)$] The special ortogonal group $SO(N)$ of dimension $N$ is the group of isometries of $ℝ^N$ that maintain the origin as a fixed point and that preserve orientation.

Elements of this space can be represented an $N × N$ matrix with determinant $1$ (that is, $N$ vectors representing the frame of reference which are orthogonal and preserve orientation). These matrixes have the property that, for $R ∈ SO(N)$, we have that $\trans{R} = \inv{R}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Special Euclidean group $SE(N)$] The special euclidean group $SE(N)$ of dimension $N$ is the group of all isometries of $ℝ^N$ that preserve orientations. These isometries can be thought of as a rotation of $SO(N)$ and a displacement given by a vector $ℝ^N$, and with the matrix representation from \eqref{eq:SE3MatrixRepr}.
\end{defn}

So, now on for computations, we can see how multiplication works \( \label{eq:SE3Mult} \begin{pmatrix} Q_1 & q_1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} ·  \begin{pmatrix} Q_2 & q_2 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} Q_1 Q_2 & Q_1q_2 + q_1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and also the inverse operation \( \begin{pmatrix} Q & q \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \trans{Q} & - \trans{Q} q \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Something about relative rotations that I will copy later.

\section{Curves in $SE(3)$}

We are not only interested in the static picture of $SE(3)$: we actually want to study uniparametric families of these matrixes or, in other words, curves in $SE(3)$.

What we will study will be configurations of a ``tube'', ``rod'' or filaments, which actually will be considered as curves $X(τ) ∈ SE(3)$ for $τ ∈ (a,b)$.

Our first example is a curve in $ℝ^3$ with its Frenet frame of reference. Let's define both things:

\begin{defn}[Frenet\IS frame of reference] \label{def:FrenetFrame}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Frenet\IS curve] A Frenet curve $\mathcal{F}(τ)$ in $SE(3)$ is a regular curve $\vr(τ)$ in $ℝ^3$ together with its \nref{def:FrenetFrame}: \[ \mathcal{F}(τ) = \begin{pmatrix} F(τ) & \vr(τ) \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \]
\end{defn}
